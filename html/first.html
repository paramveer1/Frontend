    <p>Jaipur was founded by Rajput chief of Kachhwaha clan Jai Singh II on 18 November 1727, who ruled the region from 1699 to 1743.
        
        He planned to shift his capital from Amber, 11 kilometres (7 mi) to Jaipur to accommodate the growing population and
         increasing scarcity of water.[15] Jai Singh consulted with several architects while 
         planning the layout of Jaipur and established the city on the principles of Vastu Shastra and Shilpa Shastra under the architectural guidance of Vidyadhar Bhattacharya.
          The construction of the city began in 1726. During the rule of Sawai Ram Singh II, the city was painted pink to welcome Albert 
          Edward, Prince of Wales in 1876.[17] Many of the avenues still remain painted in pink, giving Jaipur a distinctive appearance and the epithet Pink city.[18]

        In the 19th century, the city grew rapidly and had a population of 160,000 in 1900.
         The wide boulevards were paved and its chief industries were the working of metals and marble, fostered by a school of art 
         founded in 1868.[19] In August 1981, large areas of the city including the airport were flooded due to heavy rains from a c
         loud burst, resulting in the death of eight people and much damage to the city's Dravyavati River.
          On 6 July 2019, the city was named to the World Heritage Cities list.[22]</p>

            Although colloquially Delhi and New Delhi are used interchangeably to refer to the National Capital Territory of Delhi, 
            both are distinct entities, with the municipality and the New Delhi district forming a relatively small part
             within the megacity of Delhi.
